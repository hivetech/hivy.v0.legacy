# Set the location of the salt master server, if the master server cannot be
# resolved, then the minion will fail to start.
master: localhost
#
# Explicitly declare the id for this minion to use, if left commented the id
# will be the hostname as returned by the python call: socket.getfqdn()
# Since salt uses detached ids it is possible to run multiple minions on the
# same machine but with different ids, this can be useful for salt compute
# clusters.
id: vagrant-hivy

# Set the file client, the client defaults to looking on the master server for
# files, but can be directed to look at the local file directory setting 
# defined below by setting it to local.
